# go-xbuild-go v1.0.6

Added support for arbitrary `go build` arguments and improved argument parsing 
(flag `-build-args`)

These binaries are built with `go-xbuild-go -build-args '-ldflags "-s -w" -trimpath'

Please look at [ChangeLog](ChangeLog.md) for details on what has changed 
in the current version. 

* The binaries are cross-compiled with [go-xbuild-go](https://github.com/muquit/go-xbuild-go)
* The release was made with [go-xbuild-go](https://github.com/muquit/go-xbuild-go) as well.

Do not forget to check checksums of the archives before using.
