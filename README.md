# go-xbuild-go

A [Go](https://go.dev/) program to cross compile 
[Go](https://go.dev/) projects without the complexity of [GoReleaser](https://goreleaser.com/).

It was written from the frustration of using [GoReleaser](https://goreleaser.com/). I don't 
release often, whenever the time comes to release using GoReleaser, 
something has changed.
I got tired of dealing with GoReleaser's complexity when I only release
software occasionally. When I release every 6-12 months or so, GoReleaser's
config often needs updates due to changes. This simple program just works.

This is a [Go](https://go.dev/) port of my bash script https://github.com/muquit/go-xbuild

## Features
- Simple to use and maintain
- Cross compile for multiple platforms
- Special handling for Raspberry Pi (modern and Jessie)
- Generates checksums
- Creates archives (ZIP for Windows, tar.gz for others)
- No complex configuration files
- Just uncomment platforms in platforms.txt to build for them

## Options

```
A program to cross compile go programs
  -help
    	Show help information and exit
  -version
    	Show version information and exit
```

## Quick Start

Install [Go](https://go.dev/) first

```bash
go install github.com/muquit/go-xbuild-go@latest
go-xbuild-go -version
```

## Download

Download pre-compiled binaries from
[Releases](https://github.com/muquit/go-xbuild-go/releases) page

## Building from source

Install [Go](https://go.dev/) first

```bash
git clone https://github.com/muquit/go-xbuild-go
cd go-xbuild-go
go build .
```

## How to use

- Copy go-xbuild-go somewhere in your PATH. If you followed the step in *Quick Start*, it should
   be  already in your path.
- Copy *platforms.txt* to your go project's root directory.
- Create a VERSION file with your version (e.g., v1.0.1).
- Edit platforms.txt to uncomment the platforms you want to build for.

go programs can be cross compiled for more than 40 platforms. `go tool dist list` for the list
supporeted by your version of go.

A few lines of platforms.txt is shown below:
```text
########################################################################
# GOOS/GOARCH
# generated by running: go tool dist list
# Uncomment or add platforms if needed
########################################################################
#aix/ppc64
#android/386
darwin/amd64
darwin/arm64
windows/amd64
#linux/386
linux/amd64
#linux/arm
#linux/arm64
...
```

## Usage
Run go-xbuild-go from the root of your project.  Update VERSION file if needed.
Then, compile the binaries:

```bash
go-xbuild-go
```

The program will:
1. Detect your project name from the directory
2. Read version from VERSION file
3. Build for all uncommented platforms in platforms.txt
4. Create appropriate archives (ZIP for Windows, tar.gz for others)
5. Generate checksums for all archives
6. Place all artifacts in _./bin_ directory

## Output Structure
```
bin/
├── project-v1.0.1-darwin-amd64.d.tar.gz
├── project-v1.0.1-darwin-arm64.d.tar.gz
├── project-v1.0.1-windows-amd64.d.zip
├── project-v1.0.1-linux-amd64.d.tar.gz
├── project-v1.0.1-raspberry-pi.d.tar.gz
├── project-v1.0.1-raspberry-pi-jessie.d.tar.gz
└── project-v1.0.1-checksums.txt
```

## Included Files
The following files will be included in archives if they exist:
- Compiled binary
- README.md
- LICENSE.txt
- docs/project-name.1 (man page)

## How to make a release

Now that you cross-compiled and created archives for your go project, here is how
I use [gh](https://cli.github.com/) cli to create releases and upload the assets
for the release to github.

* Get github token from _Profile image -> Settings -> Developer Settings_
* Click on _Personal access tokens_
* Select _Tokens (classic)_
* Select the Checkbox at the left side of _repo_
* Click on _Generate token_ at the bottom
* Copy the token. You will not see it again
* Save the token in a secure way

Look at VERSION file, use that as release tag.

Then run:

```
cat VERSION
v1.0.1
export GITHUB_TOKEN=gihub_token
gh release create v1.0.1 \
       --notes 'my release note' \
       'bin/*'
gh release list
```
