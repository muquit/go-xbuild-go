## Background and Motivation

It was written from the frustration of using [GoReleaser](https://goreleaser.com/). I don't 
release often, whenever the time comes to release using GoReleaser, 
something has changed.
I got tired of dealing with GoReleaser's complexity when I only release
software occasionally. When I release every 6-12 months or so, GoReleaser's
config often needs updates due to changes. This simple program just works. 
Hope you will find it useful and fun to use.

This is a [go](https://go.dev/) port of my bash script https://github.com/muquit/go-xbuild

Pull requests, suggestions are always welcome.
