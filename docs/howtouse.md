## How to use

There are two ways to use go-xbuild-go:

**For simple projects (legacy mode):**
- Copy `go-xbuild-go` somewhere in your PATH
- Copy `platforms.txt` to your go project's root directory
- Create a `VERSION` file with your version (e.g., v1.0.1)
- Edit `platforms.txt` to uncomment the platforms you want to build for
- Run: `go-xbuild-go`

**For complex projects with multiple binaries (new in v1.0.5):**
- Copy `go-xbuild-go` somewhere in your PATH
- Create a `build-config.json` file (see [Multi-Binary Configuration](#multi-binary-configuration))
- Run: `go-xbuild-go -config build-config.json`

Look at [How to release your project to github](#how-to-release-your-project-to-github)

Note: go programs can be cross compiled for more than 40 platforms. `go tool dist list` for the list
supported by your version of go.

A few lines of platforms.txt is shown below:
```text
########################################################################
# GOOS/GOARCH
# generated by running: go tool dist list
# Uncomment or add platforms if needed
